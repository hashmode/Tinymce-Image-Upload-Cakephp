## Installation

Considers that tinymce is already installed 

1. Copy TinymceElfinder folder into app/Plugin and Load Plugin adding `CakePlugin::load('TinymceElfinder');` line into `bootstrap.php`
2. Copy `elfinder.php` config file into `app/Config` folder
3. Add the helper and component in your controller 
```
public $helpers = array('TinymceElfinder.TinymceElfinder');
public $components = array('TinymceElfinder.TinymceElfinder');
```

4. In tinymce init add `file_browser_callback:elFinderBrowser`, and before the script tag(or file), where the tinymce init is located, add this 
`<?php $this->TinymceElfinder->defineElfinderBrowser()?>`

5. Create 2 functions in your controller,  
```
	public function elfinder() {
		$this->TinymceElfinder->elfinder();
	}
	public function connector() {
		$this->TinymceElfinder->connector();
	}
```

  and replace my_controller with your controller's name in `elfinder.php` config file


6. Create folder `Uploads` under `webroot/img`(default, can be changed from elfinder.php)

## Options
In elfinder.php config file 
`window_url` and  `connector_url` - are the urls by which the file manager window and connector are called, should be according to in which controller you create `elfinder()` and `connector()` functions(these can be changed as well), as described in 5th step.
For cake version 2.4 and above in config file use `Router::fullbaseUrl()`, otherwise `FULL_BASE_URL`

All the rest options are the elfinder plugin options

## IMPORTANT
If you get some error and than fix it be sure to empty the browser's Cache: CTRL + F5 will NOT help, perhaps because of iframes.
